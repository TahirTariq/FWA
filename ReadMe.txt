Hi,

Provided solution is far from complete, in this inital version, I have tried to set the
project structure first, thiking that it may be the aim of the task rather just few simple methods.
It is unfortunate that I have spent 3 hours on this but couldn't complete the simple methods.

I am submitting the code base with a hope that It should give a good idea to the reviewer 
about my capability or may be I'll get more time to finish the task.

Next things in my TODO list are :

1 - Completing the required functions/end points. 
2 - Add IDisposable to Repositories
3 - Mocking the EF context using following approach.
